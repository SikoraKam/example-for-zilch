The application includes a couple of typical solutions used in react native mobile applications. 
There is navigation created using react-navigation. There is a form using react-hook-form with error handling. I used the fake api to download items to the FlatList. There is global app state management via zustand. I created a simple animation using reanimated. A device memory was also used to store state between sessions. Is integration with an external library, Unit tests were written in Jest and testing-library. 

I have tried to show in this rather simple application how I structure my code and a couple of examples of solutions that I use more when implementing real features.
